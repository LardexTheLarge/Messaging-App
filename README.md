  ## Installation

  Copy code over to your machine using `git clone git@github.com:LardexTheLarge/Messaging-App.git` and once you have it installed you can run `npm install` to get all the npm packages installed in the client and server. There is no seed data so you will have to make a chatroom in mongodb to use the app.

  ## Usage

  Once a user is on the home page they will be presented with 6 chatboxes which are the chatrooms. They will have a message in place of the join button to tell the user they need to login to access the chatbox. Once the user has read that alert they will find a login and signup button in the nav bar in the top right. They navigate to sign up where they are presented with a username, passwork, and email input box. After finalizing the sign up process the user will be relocated to the homepage with all the chatboxes. The alert will be replaced with a join bution and once in the chatbox the user will be able to send a message that anyone in the chat room will see.
